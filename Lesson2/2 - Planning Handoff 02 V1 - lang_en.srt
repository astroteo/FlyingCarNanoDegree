00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,285
Congratulations you've finished the lessons on motion planning,

2
00:00:03,285 --> 00:00:04,799
and with the tools you've developed,

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,154
you're ready to complete your next project.

4
00:00:07,155 --> 00:00:09,870
In this project, you'll again be flying in a simulator,

5
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:12,894
but this time in a more complicated 3D environment.

6
00:00:12,894 --> 00:00:14,794
So Andy, how is this going to work?

7
00:00:14,794 --> 00:00:16,769
Well Nick, basically, we're going to take

8
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:19,829
the methods and the algorithms that you've laid out in these lessons,

9
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:23,654
and going to combine them to build an amazing 3D motion planner.

10
00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:27,341
So, Nick's laid out a lot of material in the past several lessons.

11
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:29,580
And now, it's up to you to design and build

12
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:32,769
a motion planner for your quadcopter. But don't worry.

13
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,140
I'm going to show you how to build up

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,109
that baseline implementation that you need for this project.

15
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:39,000
And then, if you're feeling inspired,

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,890
you can take it to the next level with some of

17
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,054
the more advanced techniques that Nick presented.

18
00:00:43,054 --> 00:00:44,395
How does that sound to you Nick?

19
00:00:44,395 --> 00:00:46,650
That sounds pretty good to me Andy.

20
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,219
I can't wait to see what you build.
